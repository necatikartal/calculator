A small calculator program for my java lecture.
 * A small parser calculator program that using Shunting-yard algorithm to solve infix type expression inputs.
 * Invalid operators are (+,-,*,/).

For students, you will only use '[ICalculator.java](/src/com/neco4j/calculator/ICalculator.java), [IOperator.java](/src/com/neco4j/calculator/IOperator.java) and [IStack.java](/src/com/neco4j/calculator/IStack.java)' interfaces to develop your own calculator program during the lecture.
